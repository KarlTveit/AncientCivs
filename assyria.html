								The Assyrians were established when the Kingdom of Ashur came to be in the upper valley of the Tigris-Euphrates in around 2000 B.C. In 1700 B.C. it became under dominion of Babylon, then in 1530 was invaded by charioteers called Kassites.

								After the neighbouring kingdom of Mitanni was defeated by charioteering nomads, Assyria could expand. Two successive kings managed to conquer the entire Tigris-Euphrates valley. By 1200 B.C. the Assyrian Empire was large, powerful and brutal. They sacked enemy cities and killed their inhabitants to lower the morale of the fighters. This caused long lasting hateful relationships with many neighbours, and the Empire was on the decline after some time. It reclaimed parts of its empire multiple times, but could not seem to hold on to it.

								From 900 B.C. the Assyrian Empire grew stronger with mighty military traditions. They were more brutal than ever, killing prisoners without mercy.They made technological advancements in ironmaking, and had the first army completely kitted out with iron weapons. Their horsemanship was also world class, making their conquest successful. They took the entirety of the eastern mediterranean. By 700 B.C. it was the most powerful empire the world had yet seen. It further expanded to Israel and eventually Egypt. The capital was the largest and most beautiful city of the time, having the largest library of over 20,000 clay tablets. The brutality of the warmongering came back to haunt the Assyrians as many entities rebelled at once in 600 B.C. The empire was not able to crush the rebellions and what had been the greatest empire on earth an century before, was wiped out.

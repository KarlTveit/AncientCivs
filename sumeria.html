								The sumerians began to use bronze tools and, about 3500 B.C., entered the "Bronze Age." Another enormous advance introduced by the clever Sumerians was the wheel. Its first use may possibly the "potter's wheel", used in making round pottery with a spinning surface. This was adapted to be used in transport by carriage and in agriculture.

								Being the most advanced and complex civilization of the time, life became more complex as well. People kept track of how much grain they produced and paid to a percentage to a common fund (taxes).
								As it became difficult to remember everything, markings were needed. Several marks became useful, and it became a crude alphabet and number system based on 12, 60 and 360 eventually, since these numbers could easily be divided evenly in many ways. To this day we have 12 to the dozen and 60 minutes in an hour. They wrote by hammering a wedge in soft clay. Since one word corresponded to one symbol, it became hard to remember the symbols for all the words one used, so few were litterary. 

								In 3000 B.C., the Sumerian cities were prosporous. The city of Uruk was ruled by the legendary King Gilgamesh. He built a brick wall around the city six miles long. They built temples called Ziggurats, which looked like pyramids with big steps. The legend about the Tower of Babel is thought to be about the building of a massive Ziggurat.

								2500 B.C.
								Around this time, Sumerian cities received a huge shock that made them fall behind the Egyptians. This shock is thought to be a massive flood. It is estimated that the flood was around 7.5 meters high and covered almost the entirety of Sumeria. Many people must have died or fled. Giving the extent of the flood, people must have thought the whole world ended, giving birth to the Legend of Gilgamesh which was inspiration to the Jewish and Christian legends of Adam and Eve as well as Noah and the Flood. After the flood, the different cities went to war with each other to try and grab land from their neighbours.

								2000 B.C
								After 2500 B.C., warfare among the Sumerian cities weakened them all. By 2350 B.C. there was a winner called Lugalzaggisi of Umma who took control over all Sumeria. Meanwhile in Akkad, north of Sumeria, there was a ruler named Sargon of Agade. According to legend, as a baby he was found in a basket in the river. This was later applied to Moses by biblical writers. Sargon defeated Lugalzaggisi and united Sumer and Akkad as well as vast regions to the south, west and north. Sargons effectivity was because of military advancements. Thus Sargon became the first great conqueror of history. After some hundred years, the Akkadian Empire fell, allowing the Sumerian ciries to recover and control their own destinies once again. The city of Ur took the leadership. According to Hebrew legend, this is the city Abraham came from, and around 2000 B.C. left for Canaan.

								After 2000 B.C. the Sumerians rapidly declined and passed out of history, although their language persisted for another 2000 years (as latin is today), before dying out altogether.

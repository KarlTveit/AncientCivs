				<h4 class="intro">I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
								Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
								Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
								Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
								And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
								Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
								Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
								The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
								And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br>
								My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br>
								Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br>
								Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
								Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>
								The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								"Ozymandias" by Percy Bysshe Shelley (1817)

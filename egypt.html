								Egypt was very fortunate in its possession of the Nile. Not only was it a source of water for a rainless land, but it flooded anually and fertilized the land in a kind of automatic irregation. There were no storms and could be floated on with ease. Furthermore, the river flows almost due north, while the wind almost always blows south, meaning one could transport ships either way without oars. This made communication and trade amongst the city-states along the Nile easy and thus formed Upper and Lower Egypt.

								Egyptians quickly picked up writing from the Sumerians, but with other signs. These were called hieroglyphic, meaning "priestly writing" in Greek, because the Greeks later mainly came in contact with temples. Egyptian city-states grew fast, and their borders clashed against each other. This meant not only hostilities, but cooperation. The city-states in the lower part of the Nile formed a loose union known as "Lower Egypt" and the ones higher on the Nile formed "Upper Egypt". In 3100 B.C. they were united by Narmer, who made the new capital of Memphis. Narmer was the first king of the first "dynasty". Each dynasty represented a family that ruled Egypt for a period of time. Being isolated by deserts to the east and west, jungle to the south and sea to the north, Egypt could develop in peace.

								Egypt became the most prosperous and advanced nation in the world. The calendar we use today was created in Egypt in this period. The Sumerians worked out that by observing that there are 12 new moons in the cycle of a season. To keep up with the seasons, a 13th month had to be added every once in a while. This calendar is still used in Judaism. The Egyptians used the flooding of the Nile instead, caused by the melting of snow in the mountains. They calculated that there is 365 days between each flooding. They divided this by 12 and got 30 day months plus 5 days that belonged to no month.
								The ruler of Egypt was known as the Pharaoh, and soon the people were tasked with building great monuments to show how great the Pharaoh was. Palaces, statues and tombs that were safe from grave robbing were constructed. In 2650 B.C., Zoser of the Third Dynasty decided to build a 60 meter tall step-pyramid in his honour. This is the oldest large stone structure on earth today. It set a fashion, and Pharaos began building more and more advanced pyramids. This climaxed when Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty built "The Great Pyramid" in 2530 B.C. It was made of 2.3 million large blocks, weighing an average of 2.5 tons each. The 146 meter tall structure would be extremely hard to build, even with todays technology.

								In this period Egypt suffered decline due to fights amongst the pharoah and the nobility. The king was weak, and the lords of the different areas in Egypt took more power over their lands. Thus the reign became more and more similar to feudalism. Close to 2000 B.C., the King regained much of the power, and the economy and military began to fare better.

								Having regained centralized control by the Pharoahs rule, Egypt extended southwards into Nubia, todays Sudan. In about 1720 B.C., a new threat loomed. A new trend among nomadic groups was to strap chariots to horses. The horse was controlled by one man, while another man had a spear or bow. This easily defeated the foot soldiers of egypt, not yet invaded by any force. The foreigners called Hyksos took over control over the north eastern part of Egypt. Two dynasties of Hyksos kings ruled. Canaanites were treated kindly by Egypts Asian rulers. This may have given rise to the Biblical tale of Joseph and his brothers. After a while Egyptians regained power and made chariots of their own and drove out the Hyksos. They followed them over the Sinai peninsula and took control of Canaan. Thus the Egyptian Empire was established.

								With the new chariots, the Egyptian king Tuthmosis III expanded the Egyptian Empire. By 1450 B.C. it had reached its maximum expansion, being the strongest, richest and most advanced nnation in the world with a population of nearly 3 million. It continued until Tuthmosis' great grandson inherited the throne. He was the first Pharaoh who was a montheist, meaning he only believed in one god, The Sun God "Aton". The people and the priesthood were not happy, and the empire fell in decline. However, his son-in-law Tutankhamen seized power and reverted to the old ways. He is known today because his crypt was not robbed, until 1922. From 1304 B.C. Rameses II ruled. He is perhaps best known now from the biblical tale of Moses. From 1188 B.C., Egypt was invaded from the sea. They fought off the invaders, but the Egyptians were made weary. By 1000 B.C the Egyptian Empire was no more. After this, they remained a minor power. The great days were gone, leaving behind only the monuments, pyramids, sphinx, obelisks, tombs and temples to impress later generations.

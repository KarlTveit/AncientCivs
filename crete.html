								The island of Crete entered the Bronze Age about 2600 B.C. when the "Minoan" civilization was established as the first in Europe. The name is derived from the legendary Minos who was the ruler of Crete in Greek myths.

								The Cretes in this period did not have the wheel and writing only appeared towards the end of the period. However, they had strong ships, and were very good sailors. Thus they could fend of any invaders and control all trade in the eastern mediterranean.

								Crete reached the peak of it's power in this period. It dominated the Aegan Sea and its coastlines. By 1600 B.C., invading tribes entered the land we now call Greece and became the people we call Greeks. The called themselves Hellenes and the land Hellas. Crete controlled large parts of Hellas and received gold treasure and hostages from Athens. North of Crete was the Minoan island called Thera, which was really the top of a volcano. In about 1500 B.C. the volcano exploded in the most violent volcanic erruption in history, reducing Thera to a mere whole in the ground. This could have given rise to the legend of the sunken city of Atlantis. Volcanic ashes rained on Crete, greatly damaging it. The Minoan civilization came to an end.
